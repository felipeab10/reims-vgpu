//! Host-owned window presentation — a `winit` window that presents the guest
//! frame on the running rail's own device, replacing QEMU's UI
//! ([[host-window]]).
//!
//! This file owns the window and the event loop, and nothing else. The native
//! surface, the drawables and the fitted blit belong to whichever rail is
//! running and are reached only through [`crate::backend::Backend`]'s
//! `window_*` methods — a `VkSurfaceKHR` and a swapchain on the Vulkan rail, a
//! `CAMetalLayer` on the Metal one. What is left here is *when* to present, and
//! the input half: window events become [`HostAction`]s via
//! [`super::input_map`] and reach the [`InputSink`] the device wires to its
//! prompt action queue.
//!
//! The rail prefers its own resident, which is what keeps a presented layer
//! from crossing host memory at all; the CPU-BGRA [`FrameSlot`] the device
//! fills from its present capture is the source for the frames no resident
//! carries — the firmware framebuffer, any mapping the compositor has not
//! rendered into, and every frame on a rail that holds no residents.
//!
//! There is exactly one presenter, on every platform and every rail. A rail
//! that cannot present to this surface gets a named refusal and a shutdown
//! rather than a second device of its own; `resumed` records why.
//!
//! Linux owns the event loop on a dedicated thread. macOS requires AppKit work
//! on the process main thread, so QEMU creates it through
//! [`start_main_thread`] during device realize and then makes
//! [`run_main_thread`] its process-main UI loop.

/// announces: the `stop` flag the device sets at teardown, and the
/// [`GUEST_RESIZE_WARN_AFTER`] alarm, which is a deadline this has to be able to
/// observe. A tenth of that alarm keeps the age it reports within 10 % of the
/// constant it is measured against, which is what fixes this value; it is not
/// tuned against a frame rate and must not be read as one.
///
/// It also bounds the two outcomes that ask to be retried without a new frame:
/// a `Busy` presenter, and a publish that arrives in the instant between the
/// wake and the redraw. Both come back within one backstop rather than waiting
/// for the guest's next frame.
///
/// # This replaced a 2 ms poll, and the poll was 98 % waste
///
/// The loop used to ask for a redraw every 2 ms and let [`needs_present`]
/// throw away whatever the seq gate rejected. Driven x86/PCI boot, window-drag
/// probe, whole run:
///
/// ```text
///   ticks          145675     (997/s — one wake per poll, one per redraw event)
///   redraws_asked   72227     (494/s)

///   draws_stale     70961     (486/s — 98.2 % of every redraw asked for)
/// ```
///
/// A stale draw costs no GPU work at all — [`App::draw`] returns at the seq gate
/// before `window_present_frame` — so this was never the 510-presents/s spin the
/// poll was introduced to kill. What it cost was host CPU on a machine the
/// device shares: ~1000 event-loop wakes and ~486 frame-slot mutex acquisitions
/// a second to find 8.7 frames. The publisher knows when it publishes; asking it
/// to say so costs one channel send per frame at the 26 Hz this workload peaks
/// at.
///
/// # After
///
/// Same probe and host, quiesced, on a guest running a heavier animation than
/// the boot above — so read the rates against each other, not the frame counts:
///
/// ```text
///                       poll     wake
///   ticks/s              997      108
